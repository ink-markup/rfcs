# Concept

## General

- there should always be only one way to do something
- markup should look familiar (shouldn't invent anything new)
- no ambiguous markup
- graceful degrading (no parse errors)
- extensibility (extensible blocks)
- should also look fairly good when viewed as plain text


## Rules

- Lines in text do not generate line breaks
- Lines terminated by two or more spaces generate a line break
- Line starter symbols (#, >, -, etc) only work when used in the first column (white space is not ignored)
- Line starter symbols only work when followed by at least one space
- Trailing whitespace is fine and doesn't break anything

## TBD

- File extension
- More syntax
- HTML Rendering
