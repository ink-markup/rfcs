# Concept

## Rules

- Lines in text do not generate line breaks
- Lines terminated by two or more spaces generate a line break
- Line starter symbols (#, >, -, etc) only work when used in the first column (white space is not ignored)
- Line starter symbols only work when followed by at least one space
- Trailing whitespace is fine and doesn't break anything
