# Introduction

## Why another markup language?

## Audience

Squid is intended for simple documents (e.g. notes, readme files, blog posts, ...). There are other tools available for advanced documents (LaTeX).

## Goals

- It should be safe to parse and render (especially in the context of web applications).
- It should have syntax that is familiar or easy to learn.
- It should stay agnostic to the output format.
- It should never offer more than one way to express something.
- It should care about document structure and semantics.

> TODO: Is there something missing in this list?

## Mascot

The mascot is named _Ink the Squid_ to pay homage to [my first attempt at a markup language](https://github.com/timetabio/Ink).

The logo depicting _Ink_ has been designed by [@NotAWeeb](https://github.com/notaweeb).
